# codemirror-network
CodeMirror simple mode for highlighting network data (email, HTTP headers, WHOIS)

This highlighting mode is designed to highlight common network data formats including RFC5322 (email) headers, HTTP headers, and WHOIS results.
These types follow the common structure of `Keyword: data`, and therefore can be highlighted generically using the same language mode.
